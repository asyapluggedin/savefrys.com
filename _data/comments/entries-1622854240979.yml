" The first time I ever went to Fry’s Electronics, it was to buy an external monitor. I was editing my first short film, and had come to a point in my creative practice where I felt comfortable justifying hardware purchases for the sake of my art. My friend Landon Thomas told me that Fry’s was the best place to buy a monitor, because of their large assortment and price matching policy. I was incredibly impressed when we showed up in Burbank – I wasn’t sure at first why we had to drive so far to buy a monitor, but once I saw the UFO crashed into the storefront…. I realized the trip was all worth it. There was something about that day that I will never forget.  \r\n\r\n Landon taught me a lot of the things I know about hardware, so I always thought of our shopping trips as significant for my education in tech. Eventually I started work as an educator in tech, and would encourage my students, who were mostly children, to check out Fry's Electronics. I was happy that I could recommend a place that was fun and not intimidating like the rest of tech culture.  \r\n\r\n  Most recently, I helped my 12 year old brother build a gaming PC. He had never heard of Fry's Electronics, so I decided to surprise him for Christmas, and to reward him with a gift card of a dollar amount equivalent to his YouTube subscriber count. This complicated idea wasn't something that a standard superstore giftcard, so instead of getting him a Fry's gift card (what a financial mistake that would have been), I designed a Fry's branded plane ticket to symbolize the trip to the Burbank store. \r\n\r\n  " <img src="/img/FrysTicket.png">
"When we finally made it to the store (which was only February), all we could find was a hard drive. There were no decennt motherboards, very few PC cases, and I couldn't even find myself a Logitech mouse. We walked through the odd long aisles, he  marveled at the cases of iced tea priced at $1.50 for a dozen bottles. I saw some odd end caps selling microwave dinner devices."

 "I ended up buying a glow-in-the-dark SATA cable for $1 or $2. I didn't need one, or even really remember what they are for, but I picked it up because I had never seen a glow-in-the-dark cable before and thought that if I had been shopping online I would have never discovered it. We had made a huge deal out of driving out to Burbank, so I decided to spend the $2 on an unnecessary cable, knowing I could probably return it if it ever became too huge a nuisance in my life."
