  The first time I ever went to Fry’s Electronics, it was to buy an external
  monitor. I was editing my first short film, and had come to a point in my
  creative practice where I felt comfortable justifying hardware purchases for
  the sake of my art. My friend Landon Thomas told me that Fry’s was the best
  place to buy a monitor, because of their large assortment and price matching
  policy. I was incredibly impressed when we showed up in Burbank – I wasn’t
  sure at first why we had to drive so far to buy a monitor, but once I saw the
  UFO crashed into the storefront…. I realized the trip was all worth it.
