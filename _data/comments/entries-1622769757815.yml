message: "The Fry's in Dallas used to an Incredible Universe, which was owned by Tandy (Radio Shack).  They had little living room mockups for listening to home theater surround sound.  I would've lived in that store, if I could.  The transition to Fry's happened prior to my becoming involved in modern PCs.  Once I realized what used to be there, it instantly felt like home.  The sales ad used to come out every Friday in the Dallas Morning News.  I bought the paper just for that ad.  I remember standing there with the guy who delivered Chinese food to a place I worked in downtown comparing the items we had circled.  He barely spoke English and I speak no Chinese, but smiling and pointing to our respective papers let us communicate just fine.  Later as I moved more professionally into tech work, I was in the store so often, the people in PC parts knew me on sight.  No sales pitches came my way.  I knew what I wanted and they knew I'd find a salesperson, after the fact, for an easy commisioned sale.  I went in around Jan of 2020 and couldn't find a network cable.  I knew it was almost over.  It's sad to see it go.  I've sold motherboards, memory, and even, a TV antenna while shopping there as a customer.  Hopefully something will fill the void.  Being able to walk in to a store and speak nerd to a stranger ogling the same shiny electronic doodads you are is a pretty cool experience.  Whoever you were outside the store, you all had something in common inside it.\r\n\r\nComment archived from <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-D3jAGsRTE\"> youtube </a>"
