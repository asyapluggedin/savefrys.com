  I remember watching an interview of Elon Musk from my home in Moscow, hearing
  how Tesla engineers ransacked all the Fry’s stores in Northern California to
  supply Tesla cars with a USB cable. Later on when I moved to Pleasanton I
  would drive by the Fry’s store in Fremont and remember that story.
