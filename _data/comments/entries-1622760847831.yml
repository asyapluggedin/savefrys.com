  Growing up I came here with my dad to get parts to build my own PC. I honestly
  never thought it would close, it was too iconic. Perhaps I was naive but it
  felt like somebody would swoop in and save the day, perhaps some silicon
  valley B'naire with crypto money to burn and a soft spot for DIY electronics
  or some Texas Oil Baron who grew up building their own PCs. It's more than the
  end of an era, its the sign of our society collectively shrugging at the
  changes imposed on us by late stage capitalism. However, this digital memorial
  and the associated community has made me realize that I'm not alone in
  mourning and perhaps there is room for us to build something similar or better
  in its place. Something more sustainable that matches the zeitgeist. RIP Fry's
  Electronics, Long Live Fry's 2.0
