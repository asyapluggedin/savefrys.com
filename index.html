            <p>Today, the SaveFrys.com website boasts a significant update as it is being showcased as an art project in the <a href="https://gestalt.sh/">UCLA Design | Media Arts Senior Undergraduate Exhibition.</a>. Certain pages have been removed, like the open letter to Kathy Kolder, John, Randy, and Dave Fry, to draw the public's attention to the archiving efforts of the project.</p>
            <p>The website will only grow with time, so we encourage all visitors to keep monitoring these pages to hear about all the Fry's Electronics memorial related updates.</p>

            <p>Activity reported outside of Store #11 (Burbank) – a Zio Studios filming equipment truck has been spotted, as well as a yellow filming location sign. It appears that the reason this particular Fry's Electronics location has been closed off with a fence wasn't just something to do with the fact that Fry's owns the building, but additionally to ensure no trespassing onto a film site. The Zio Studios website boasts they have worked on productions associated with CBS, Warner Brothers, Disney (via Marvel), and Universal Studios, among several others.</p>
            <p>Store #11 is located nearby WB, NBC, ABC and Disney, and employees would frequently run into celebrities, meaning the the location was a favourite among the Hollywood crowd. Jay Leno, Tim Allen, Ben Afflack, Stevie Wonder, and Seal were all reportedly customers of Store #11 – the store was so popular with celebrities that it was even shut down once to accomodate Michael Jackson as he shopped with his family.</p>

            <p>According to an Instagram post from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CPkstKCnQeF/?">@janettwokay</a>, the Sunnyvale location has removed the storefront decor with the iconic wavelength logo.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://discord.gg/ngHNn983Yr">Fry's 2.0 Discord Server</a> has been created.</p>
            <p>The idea for the server first emerged in a Clubhouse room hosted by Benjamin Bascom, titled "Fry's Electronics Grief Support Group". After some collective mourning and grieving, those onstage began to talk about how weird it is that the fun and excitement of shopping for electronics isn't present in e-commerce. Even with TikTok and Discord, it's just not the same. Rahul Chhabra joined the conversation and despite never visiting a Fry's himself, quickly grew enamored with the idea of creating a digital experience that would come close to the joy of visiting a Fry's Electronics store. His positive, inspiring energy began to transform the room's grief into the passion to build something new and beautiful.

                <p>The decision to choose Discord as a platform was inspired by the community shopping experiences on this platform: there are already a lot of cool Discord servers for buying electronics, like buildapc and StockDrops. Why not add one where we recreate all the zany things we love about Fry's? And so Frys 2.0 was born.</p>

            <p>Fry's Electronics has shut down.</p>
            <p>

           Their website has been removed, all for one page that reads the following:

            </p>

            <p class="fryscom">After nearly 36 years in business as the one-stop-shop and online resource for high-tech professionals across nine states and 31 stores, Fry’s Electronics, Inc. (“Fry’s” or “Company”), has made the difficult decision to shut down its operations and close its business permanently as a result of changes in the retail industry and the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. The Company will implement the shut down through an orderly wind down process that it believes will be in the best interests of the Company, its creditors, and other stakeholders.</p>


            <p class="fryscom">The Company ceased regular operations and began the wind-down process on February 24, 2021. It is hoped that undertaking the wind-down through this orderly process will reduce costs, avoid additional liabilities, minimize the impact on our customers, vendors, landlords and associates, and maximize the value of the Company’s assets for its creditors and other stakeholders.</p>


            <p class="fryscom">The Company is in the process of reaching out to its customers with repairs and consignment vendors to help them understand what this will mean for them and the proposed next steps.</p>


            <p class="fryscom" >If you have questions, please contact us using the following email addresses:
</p>

           <li> For customers who have equipment currently being repaired, please email customerservice@frys.com, to arrange for return of your equipment.</li>

           <li> For consignment vendors needing to pick up their consignment inventory at Fry’s locations, please email omnichannel@frys.com.</li>
               </ul>


            <p class="fryscom">Please understand if we are a bit slow to respond given the large volume of questions. The Company appreciates your patience and support through this process.</p>


            <p class="fryscom">Sincerely,<br><br>
