                <p>I was scouring through eBay and found this painting of the Burbank Fry's Electronics by Peter Crowell. <img src="https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/BzMAAOSwgZNgd4Xw/s-l1600.jpg"></p>
                <p>Check it out on his <a href="https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/393246242020?ul_noapp=true">eBay page</a>, as it's still available for purchase! </p>

                <p>Check out <a href="https://vimeo.com/469889629">Have You Visited Fry&#039;s?</a> by <a href="https://vimeo.com/user94478718">Gordon Viggiano</a>, posted in September 2020.</p>
                <p>His story describes a brief business relationship with Fry's Electronics that didn't work out (hint: Gordon's company got merged into Amazon instead). Despite the unsuccessful business interaction, Gordon reminisces on enjoying his visits to Fry's stores with his children. He ends his story describing a more recent visit to Fry's, which shocked him just as all of us were shocked to witness the store's demise. </p>
                <p>His final words are <strong>"Fry's, <em>please</em> return!"</strong> </p>
